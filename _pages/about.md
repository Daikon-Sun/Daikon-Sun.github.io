As an avid entrepreneur who bridges academic theory and real-world practice, my experience includes co-founding several startups, securing spots in top accelerator programs, and attending structured MBA courses at MIT/Harvard.

## Graduate
I am a Ph.D. student at [EECS, MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Duane Boning](https://www-mtl.mit.edu/wpmu/researchgroupsboning/boning/).
My research interest is foundation models for long-term sequence modeling.
I have worked on various topics of deep learning for time series, from specialized small models to general foundation models, from anomaly detection to forecasting, and from generalization to drift adaptation.
Throughtout my Ph.D., I have been heavily involved in long-term industry collaborations, such as anomaly detection for semiconductor manufacturing with Analog Devices and drift adaptation in machine health with Lam Research.

## Undergrad
I obtained my B.S. degree in [EE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) (major) and [CS](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php) (minor) at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english).
During my undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on deep learning for sequence modeling, where I proposed to use self-generated data to enable lifelong learning for GPT-2.
I also worked with [Prof. Yao-Wen Chang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ywchang/) on electronic design automation, including being the first undergrad team to win top-3 in the ISPD (physical design) Contest.

## Fun facts
I love to explore the world.
That's why I participated in the International Geography Olympiad (iGeo) and represented Taiwan to win a Silver medal.
(Bonus fun fact: that's how I met my wife!)
