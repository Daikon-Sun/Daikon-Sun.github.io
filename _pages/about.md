Hello!

I am a Ph.D. student at [EECS, MIT](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Duane Boning](https://www-mtl.mit.edu/wpmu/researchgroupsboning/boning/).

Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in EE (major) and CS (minor) at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english).
During undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and [Prof. Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) on machine learning.
I also worked with [Prof. Yao-Wen Chang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ywchang/) on electronic design automation.

My research interest is machine learning and deep learning for sequence modeling, including time series analysis and natural language processing.
